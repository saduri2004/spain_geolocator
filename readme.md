# GPS Coordinate Prediction from Image Features

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) from image features using machine learning techniques, specifically k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Linear Regression models. The dataset consists of 27.6k geo-tagged images taken in Spain, with image features extracted using OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model. The goal is to analyze and compare the performance of kNN and Linear Regression models in predicting displacement error (in miles) for different dataset sizes and model configurations.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset contains 28,616 geo-tagged images from Mousselly-Sergieh et al. 2014, scraped from Flickr in 2024.
- **Image Features**: Image features were extracted using CLIP ViT-L/14@336px.
- **Training Set**: 27,616 images
- **Test Set**: 1,000 images

## Project Steps

1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized image locations by plotting longitude and latitude values.
   - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce image features to two dimensions, visualizing image features by longitude.

2. **kNN Regression Implementation**:
   - Implemented kNN regression to predict GPS coordinates (lat, lon) for test images using the nearest neighbors from the training set.
   - Evaluated mean displacement error (miles) across different values of k (nearest neighbors).
   - Conducted grid search to find the best k, both with and without distance weighting.

3. **Baseline Model**:
   - Established a naive baseline by predicting the mean of the training set coordinates, achieving a mean displacement error of 160.3 miles.

4. **Comparison with Linear Regression**:
   - Implemented and compared Linear Regression with kNN on varying training set sizes (ratios from 10% to 100%).
   - For each ratio, compared the mean displacement error of both models.

## Key Results

- **Best k for kNN**: The optimal k value for kNN was found to be **3**.
- **Displacement Error**:
  - **kNN** consistently outperformed Linear Regression as the dataset size increased, achieving a lowest mean displacement error of **131.0 miles** for the full dataset.
  - **Linear Regression** had a lowest mean displacement error of **156.7 miles**.
